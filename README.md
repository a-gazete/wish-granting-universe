# Wish-Granting Universe

We humans are each created with free will. This is a very special gift that separates us from animals, plants and all other beings in this world. We each choose, with God’s permission and protection/watching over, the life we have, and no one else can. This world is a playground with full set of options on everything, in the scale of dualities in all combinations on whatever there is created. There are so many paths in life. Our choices are only shadowed by the way we perceive things and act on. Not even God is interfering with our choices. We each can choose good, bad, evil, weakness, prosperity, or just downright to deny God. That’s how free we are, and how generous God is. All our wishes are granted. 

Just one thing though– God’s way, i.e. the universal subconscious is good and so are we. We aren’t designed to be bad. So, you can choose the negative and live in it as much as you like. But you can’t attain that inner peace by it.

## All Our Wishes Are Granted

All of what we want is given to us. 

Doesn’t appear to be so. So, to break it down a bit in this context. Our wishes are  – 

_**..not granted, because**_:

<ul>
what we think we want isn’t always what we really want. What we want isn’t clear yet, OR, something deeper in our being is stopping that "wish" below our level of awareness. Our subconscious being and from there the Universe knows all our deepest feelings – they don't miss any. And, our subconscious being doesn’t any get ahead of us either – gets us all&only what we want. Our free will is at our consciousness level and is respected.  
</ul>

_**..seemingly not granted, because**_:

<ul>
.. of a combination of the following 3: <br>

* things are integrated into this big physical plane we live in, without disturbing the harmony of all things. All wishes are being granted, not just ours. We’ll all still exist as individuals and as various social groups, in the established orders, all fully synchronized. The state of things is being shifted to a point where all things are harmonized all around. <br>

* this world is very physical and very heavy. And our ability to think/wish/imagine/desire is very fast. Even when our heart’s desire is true&granted, it takes time for it to be “baked” into the slow-moving, mass-y, physical form. If you loose faith/desire/interest/patience during all these, it no longer will be brought to you. Universe won’t bring you something you yourself gave upon. <br>


* takes a major change for you to adopt that state. It's you/your ability to adopt to that new state of life that sets how quickly your wish is being granted. Not rarely is the case that your wish is granted&right before you. But you lost don't even see it – you’re not in a receptive state.

</ul>
 

_..**granted, because**_:
<ul>
       it is our wish/subconscious, and by design. In fact, making choices and so shaping ourselves & our lives is our obligations in this life. You’re the one in charge of all your being and things around it in this physical plane. We’re brought to this life to act & be ourselves the way we to choose to. What we become is our choice and responsibility. The choices are endless. It’s always up to us and us only which way to go. Our free-will is at our conscious level, and expanding our vision/consciousness brings more and more of these choices to our awareness. Our sincere wishes all come true. Your subconscious being, which is an agent between you and the universe, never misses the desire of your heart and carries it to the universe to be fulfilled. Knowing what you want is the key. 
</ul>

## So, What Is A True Wish?

In the middle of your daily routine – you dream of being at the beach/ideal vacation spot right there&then. Would you really take it if you could be beamed there right there&then? 

Is it just that you’d want to step aside, change the pace a bit.. Or that something external to view for a moment as an outsider.. ?

Dreaming is something else – did you even imagine living it for 30 consecutive secs?

A dress being displayed at a window or a fashion show looks very appealing – makes you turn & look & look & admire & look again. But would you put it on even if you were paid to? Would you really like it if you were in it? 

What you really want is in you. Sincerity is the way to attain it. 

Relaxed, peaceful, honest, loving, forgiving state with/towards yourself gives you the inward trajectory. But sincerity would describe the pure, untamed, unpolluted level you’d be resonating in to get the answers you’re looking for into your consciousness. You do have all your answers in your being. You become aware of them when you attain that level. Your free-will is in your consciousness. Your subconscious already knows all there is to know. You got to attain them in your consciousness so as to say “yes/no” to them at your choice. 


Not directly in the context/flow of this article, and yet to note briefly for relevance – 

The grateful/positive state you maintain keeps you well-bonded with the things out there in this life – lays a foundation where you can further receive and build on. Your positive outlook shows you, in an outward look, the harmonious-all-around paths your deepest being already knows – for your free-will to go for if it wants to. 

Acting is wishing. You’re sustaining what you really want, doing what you can at the moment towards what you really want, and turning yourself into a fine/aware receptor for the moment your wish comes finds you. Action also is a great mood-tuner – keeps you in a positive state towards your goal – takes away all the worries, eases up things for paths to open for you out there in life. Action/work & worry are inversely proportional to one another – one always goes up when the other goes down like the two ends of a seesaw, and always up to you to choose “which”.
